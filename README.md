# 🌐 Stableyard – Real-World Stablecoin Payments on Stellar

**Stableyard** enables real-world payments using **Stellar USDC**, allowing users to pay across existing QR payment networks like **ThaiQR**, **VietQR**, and **QRIS**, while merchants receive instant settlements in **local fiat**.

This repo contains the core codebase for the **Stableyard Payment Infrastructure**, built to connect **on-chain stablecoin liquidity** with **off-chain banking and payment rails**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Stableyard turns Stellar into a **programmable payment layer** that bridges stablecoins, fiat systems, and local merchant networks.

### Key Highlights
- 💱 **Stellar USDC-Powered Payments**  
  Seamless on-chain to off-chain settlement through local QR systems.

- 🧠 **Intent-Based Payment Engine**  
  Every payment is processed as a verifiable, programmable intent for transparency and composability.

- 🔒 **Compliance-Ready**  
  Integrated KYC/KYB and AML checks ensure regulatory safety for merchants and users.

- 🌍 **Real-World Integration**  
  Built to work across Asia’s leading QR payment rails — **VietQR**, **ThaiQR**, and **QRIS** — with fiat payout through licensed partners.
